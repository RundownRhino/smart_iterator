## smart_iterator
An iterator wrapper that allows chaining methods FLUENT-style rather than nesting functions. The available methods are heavily based on Rust's [Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html). In addition, it aims to be fully typehinted (to the degree allowed by Python's type system).

### Current state
First public draft: no real testing done, and only a fraction of the intended methods implemented.
